I have simplified the frontend by removing some complex animations that might have been causing the interface to flash and disappear. I have also verified that the server is running correctly. Please check if the page displays properly for you now.

Update interface to display Chinese language and AI analysis

"My app's interface loads for a split second and then disappears, leaving a blank white screen. It seems like a frontend crash or a routing issue.

Please perform the following debugging steps:

Check the frontend console logs for any 'Uncaught Runtime Errors' or 'React Minified Errors' that occur immediately after loading.

Verify the routing logic: Ensure there are no infinite redirect loops in my main App component or useEffect hooks.

Check the entry point: Ensure the root element ID in my index.html matches the one my React/frontend code is trying to mount to (usually 'root').

Check for missing Environment Variables: If the app crashes when trying to fetch data on load, ensure all API keys and secrets are correctly set.

Verify Port Binding: Confirm the server is listening on host 0.0.0.0 (not localhost) so the external URL works correctly."

Improve application styling and error handling for video analysis

Is the application interface loading correctly for you now, or are you still seeing a blank screen?

Want users to get these changes? Republish this App.
The history of analysis is public to everyone is not a good feature. I think you should create different sessions for different users. Besides, i want to add a new feature: Audience Reaction Analysis.
Please make the following changes to the backend and frontend:

Fetch Comments: Update the backend to fetch the top 20-50 comments (reviews) for the Bilibili video using the Bilibili API (likely the v2/reply endpoint using the video's oid or bvid).
Combine Context: When sending data to Gemini, do not just send the video transcript/summary. Construct a new prompt that includes:
·The Video Content (Transcript/Summary).
·The List of User Comments/Reviews.
Update Gemini Instructions: Instruct Gemini 3.0 (or the latest available model) to analyze the video in the context of these reviews. Specifically, ask it to:
·Compare the video's intended message vs. how the audience received it.
·Highlight any controversy or specific points users are debating.
·Generate its own 'meta-commentary' summarizing the general sentiment.
Frontend Update: Display this new 'Audience Insight' section below the main summary.
I'll implement the user session separation and add the "Audience Reaction Analysis" feature. This involves updating the database schema for sessions, enhancing the Bilibili API logic to fetch comments, and refining the AI prompt for deeper insights.

I'll start by updating the schema and backend logic, followed by the frontend display.

<autonomous_explanation>
Implementing user sessions and adding complex comment fetching/analysis across the full stack requires significant architectural changes. I'll switch to a more powerful mode to ensure session security and robust AI integration are handled correctly.
